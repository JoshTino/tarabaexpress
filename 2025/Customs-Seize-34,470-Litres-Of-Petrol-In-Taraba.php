Acting on this intelligence mosaic, field teams executed a series of coordinated interceptions that disrupted what appears to be an emerging smuggling corridor,” he stated.<br/><br/>“The operational outcomes from these intelligence-led interventions led to seizure of 1,149 jerry cans of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), each containing 30 liters, yielding a total volume of 34,470 litres.<br/><br/>“The seizure, including a sophisticated transportation vehicle valued at Four Million Naira (₦4,000,000), represents a total Duty Paid Value of Thirty-Seven Million, Seven Hundred and Eighty Thousand, Six Hundred Naira (₦37,780,600).<br/><br/>“The bulk interception occurred in Gembu, which is one of the critical nodal point – while 180 jerry cans and the transportation vehicle were intercepted during active movement toward the Kan-iyaka border crossing.”<br/><br/>The Customs boss stressed that smugglers are threats to the nation’s national security and should be of interest to all security agencies.<br/><br/>He also called on residents of the state and other stakeholders to cooperate with the government to ensure the gains recorded in the petroleum distribution system for local consumption are not reversed.</p><?php include '../includes/detaildown.inc.php';?>
