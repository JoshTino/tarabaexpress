Use stairs and furniture as makeshift gym equipment <br/>If you have stairs at your home or office, take them every chance you get. Don’t stop there, though. For a strong cardio workout, walk up and down the stairs repeatedly. Start with a limited number of repetitions and then increase them as you feel stronger. <br/><br/>Get even more creative by using wine bottles or a gallon of water as weights and your kitchen chairs for planks and tricep dip exercises. Why buy expensive equipment when you can utilize your furniture instead? <br/><br/>2. Drink 1 extra glass of water a day<br/>It’s nothing new that there are health benefits to drinking more water. It helps keep your temperature normal, lubricates and cushions joints, protects your spinal cord and other sensitive tissues and gets rid of wastes through urination, sweat and bowel movements. Since 50 to 75% of your weight is water, drinking some plain old H2O is imperative in keeping your body working the best it can and staying hydrated. If plain water isn’t your favorite, you can add flavor to your water to help up your intake.<br/><br/>3. Replace diet soda with carbonated water<br/>Research suggests the brain reacts to artificial sweeteners much like it does to sugary sweets. <br/><br/>“If you drink diet soda each day, use carbonated mineral water to help wean yourself off of it,” says Jeffers. “Ingesting them frequently can increase your desire for high-calorie foods and put you at risk for weight gain.”<br/><br/>If you’re not a fan of carbonated water, try drinking unflavored tea, coffee or fruit-infused plain water. Quitting cold turkey isn’t realistic but if you start decreasing the amount of diet soda and artificial sweeteners you ingest, you’ll be doing wonders for both your waistline and your health.<br/><br/>4. Take a 10-minute walk<br/>“Even a 10-minute walk can help boost your cardiovascular health,” says Travers. “Take a walk during your lunch hour or to a store that is a block away to buy a gallon of milk — it’s all good for you.”<br/><br/>If you’re at work, walk to the furthest bathroom and take the stairs. While running errands, try to find the farthest parking spot and walk from there. Remember, even the smallest amount of steps still add up. <br/><br/>Sometimes the weather doesn’t cooperate and the last thing you want to do is go outside when it’s snowing or windy, but don’t let cold weather deter you. You can often walk comfortably by dressing right: Start with a sweat-wicking layer next to your body, add insulating layers for warmth, and top them off with a waterproof shell.<br/><br/>5. Correct your posture<br/>When you were a kid, have your parents ever yelled at you for having bad posture? Well, the bad news is that they were right. Having good posture can prevent aches and can also reduce stress on your ligaments. Not only that, but good posture prevents backache, fatigue and muscle pain. <br/><br/>“You can try to leave yourself a note to sit up straight until it becomes an unconscious habit,” says Travers. “Walking with your shoulders back and head held high can also make you feel good about yourself.”<br/><br/>While teaching yourself to have better posture isn’t something that can be fixed right away, reminding yourself to sit up straight has a positive effect on your overall health.<br/><br/>6. Go to bed ½ hour earlier<br/>Do you sleep a solid seven or eight hours most nights? Many of us don’t but experts say this is a marker of good heart health. Solid sleep doesn’t just give you more energy, it can also help with healthy eating goals. When you’re short on sleep, it reduces your body’s production of hormones that suppress appetite, which can contribute to weight gain. You may have a higher risk of heart disease, obesity and high blood pressure if you suffer from untreated insomnia or sleep apnea, too. <br/><br/>Those seven to eight hours don’t have to be consecutive. If you’re feeling particularly tired, try to sneak in a short nap early in the day. Don’t overdo it, though. Limit your naps to 30 minutes to avoid falling asleep later than you should. <br/><br/>Try to head to bed ½ hour earlier than your usual time. Turn off your phone (we promise you won’t miss anything!) and wind down with a book. You’ll be falling asleep in no time.</p><?php include '../includes/detaildown.inc.php';?>
