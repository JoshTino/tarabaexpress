They have now recovered well, and we should be better physically,” Gernot Rohr told Super Eagles media.<br/><br/>“There will be some changes in the team, Francis Uzoho will be in goal, [Ahmed] Musa will start because he is fit, we lost Troost-Ekong so Valentine [Ozornwafor] will come in for the first time.”<br/><br/>Cameroon have not lost any of their last five international friendlies. Little wonder, they are favourites to defeat the West Africans</p><?php include '../includes/detaildown.inc.php';?>
